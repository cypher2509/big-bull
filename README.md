to run the game follow these steps:
step 1: create a database named "Bigbull"
step 2: run the file "app.mjs"
step 3: go to admin and create a game and use the passkey-"WolfOfWallstreet" for all the admin functions.
step 4: register the player.

to go back to the main page to access the admin controls.


database that will be used for this app is named as "Bigbull" and the collection's name would be the gameId entered when creating the game using admin controls.

Due to api call limit just two trades will be possible in a minute.
css is applied to all the webpages but it's not super clean due to lack of time. Only the login-page has the best css by my side and it's also made responsive.
